# My Portfolio Website

## Version without the backend

- In this version i removed all the backend to simplify the deployment
- Now i have a single file to add and remove and update all the projects
- The two repositories for the other version are :
  - Frontend: https://github.com/manuelloverso/frontend-portfolio
  - Backend: https://github.com/manuelloverso/backend-portfolio
